# CaterMe

EzCater does not save user cart info after the order window has passed. Because of this, there is no way for an individual employee to view what they ordered for lunch/dinner. 

CaterMe scrapes your cart data for the day and stores it in Chrome local storage for later retrieval. It runs whenever you make changes to your EzCater cart. Now we don't have to bother Kiana!
